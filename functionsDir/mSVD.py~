#* Description: Performs a Singular Value Decomposition on a given changeVResponse matrix, to find the final quadrupole strength change matrix Q
#* Argument: $1 - xFile - Comma separated data file containing X matrix values, representing initial CHI2DOF comparisons before any quadrupole strengths have been changed
#* Argument: $2 - mFile - Comma separated data file containing changeVResponse matrix values to be used in the SVD Pseudoinverse
#* Argument: $3 - qFile - Name of the output file where the Q matrix elements will be written to as a single column
#* Argument: $4 - sFile - Name of the output file where the S Matrix elements will be written to as a signle column
#* Example: python mSVD.py matrixX.fin matrixM.fin matrixQ.dat matrixS.fin
#* Further Comments: This script is functionally similar to transportSVD.py, but has be separated into two scripts for readability
#* Main Output: $CHANGEPATH/matrixQ.dat

# Inputs are of the form
# X = M * Q

# Where:

# X = Baseline chi2dof comparisons without any strength change
# M = Change vs Response matrix
# Q = Needed quadrupole strength changes

# This script finds Q

# Q = M^{-1} * X

# Store command line arguments as variables
