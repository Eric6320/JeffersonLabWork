#* Description: Used to check whether a variable has been explicitly set from the command line, or should be set to a specified default value
#* Argument: 
#* Example: set N = `$FPATH/setArg.sh N 10 $argv`
#* Further Comments: Variables passed in from the command line should take the form: ./scriptName.sh variableOneName=valueOne, variableTwoName=valueTwo,;
#* Further Comments: The comma is necessary for parsing, and is needed after every value, even the last one


# Compile and run the setVariable java script, printing the output to the terminal.
#The java script searches the command line arguments for variableOneName, and prints valueOne if it is found

#javac /a/devuser/erict/workspace/Miscellaneous/src/setVariable.java
echo `java -cp $JAVAPATH setVariable $argv`
